            <p> Apple Inc (AAPL.O) on Wednesday revealed the look of its first retail store in India.
                With Apple opening its first retail store in Mumbai later this month, followed soon after
                by another store in Delhi, the world’s most valuable tech company is digging deeper into the Indian market, 
                as its strategy to control every aspect from sales to manufacturing here starts to show dividends. 
                The retail footprint is just the beginning of a new phase of growth for Apple in India.

            <p>Google is reportedly working on a feature which will enable the Find My Device feature to work even when the concerned 
                smartphone is turned off. This feature is similar to Apple AirTags or the Find My feature available on Apple products.
                Google also recently extended its Nearby Share feature to Windows. The feature was already available on Android phones and Chromebooks.
                It allows seamless transfer between two devices, much like Apple's Airdrop feature. The report suggests that the Mountain View-based tech giant is planning to release this feature soon
